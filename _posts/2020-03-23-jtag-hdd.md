# Background
To follow up my [last post]() about SWD and hardware debugging, I wanted to do a _pseudo_ deep dive into JTAG from a reverse engineering perspective. The previous post recieved a lot of great feedback and it seems that people are interested in this topic, so I wanted to continue the series and expand upon another hardware debugging mechanism. For those who are unfamiliar, JTAG is another hardware level debugging mechanism that many embedded CPUs utilize, with this post I hope to explain how to approach JTAG from a reverse engineers perspective and provide some practical examples along the way.

## Goals

With this post, I hope to do the following:

1.) Explain how JTAG works
2.) Demonstrate how to enumerate and utilize a JTAG port/interface on an unknown target
3.) Provide an overview of some of the current OSS tools that can be used to interact with a JTAG interface 
4.) Utilize JTAG to extract firmware and debug a target 

Also, before I give an overview, I wanted to point out a few great resources for learning about JTAG

* [FPGA4Fun JTAG Overview](https://www.fpga4fun.com/JTAG.html)
