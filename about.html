<h2>About Me</h2>
<div class="aboutme">
    Welcome to my ramblings! I'm a reverse engineer with a focus on embedded systems from both hardware and a firmware perspective. My hope is to use this blog to document some side projects and learn some new skills along the way. If you have questions or comments please feel free to ping me on twitter or via email!
